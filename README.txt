TEADOC : ceylon based dependecy/configuration framework

---------------------------------
GOALS:
* lightweight & flexible
* strong seperation of concerns (config code IS NOT in business code); think classic spring
* strongly designed to enable most common case, but elegantly allow to do your own thing
* HIGHLY modular
